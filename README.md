# kairo-app

**Kairo** is a minimal productivity tool (I know..) that helps users focus and reflect during study or work sessions.

### Why?

Simple. People don't stay focused often enough and when they do, they
rarely reflect on how it went.
Kairo brings structure and awareness to your deep work sessions by
combining a smart timer with lightweight post-session reflections.

## About the Project

Kairo isn't just a timer â€” it's a tool to build _awareness_ around how you work and how you feel during focused effort.  
The goal is to help people build intentional habits, not just squeeze out more productivity.

This project is also a personal challenge: building and scaling a full-stack app from scratch using the skills I'm learning as a web developer.
