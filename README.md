# kairo-app

**Kairo** is a minimal productivity tool (I know..) that helps users focus and reflect during study or work sessions.

### Why?

Simple. People don't stay focused often enough and when they do, they
rarely reflect on how it went.
Kairo brings structure and awareness to your deep work sessions by
combining a smart timer with lightweight post-session reflections.
